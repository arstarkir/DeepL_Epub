# DeepL_Epub

A Tool for people to translate .epub books easily!

## Application concept

DeepL_Epub: An intuitive application designed to enable effortless translation of .epub books or individual chapters using the DeepL API. Originally, DeepL does not support the .epub format. 
This app bridges that gap, providing users with seamless integration to translate entire texts or selected portions within .epub files, making it easier to access and enjoy literature in multiple languages.
